# New York City Air Quality Analysis Project
## Overview
This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of air quality in New York City, focusing on major pollutants such as PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and O3. Through the exploration of these pollutants, the study aims to identify their impacts on public health, particularly in marginalized communities, and provide actionable insights for public policy and health interventions.

## Project Description
Air pollution in New York City poses significant health risks, with disparities in exposure levels impacting marginalized communities disproportionately. By utilizing public data sources, this project evaluates temporal and spatial trends in air pollutant concentrations and correlates these findings with public health data to assess the broader impacts of exposure.

## Objectives
* Identify Major Pollutants: Determine the primary pollutants affecting NYC and their sources.
* Analyze Health Impacts: Correlate pollutant concentrations with health outcomes.
* Predict Future Trends: Use machine learning models to predict future air quality.
* Inform Policy Making: Provide data-driven insights to help craft effective environmental health policies.
  
## Methodology
* Data Collection: Utilize datasets from NYC's public health data portals.
  - Air Quality Data: [NYC Health Departmentâ€™s Environmental Public Health Data Portal](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/air-quality/?id=2023#display=summary)
  - Health Impact Data: [Health Impacts of Air Pollution portal](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/health-impacts-of-air-pollution/?id=2122#display=summary).
* Health Impact Data: Health Impacts of Air Pollution portal
* Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Standardize formats, handle missing values, and remove outliers.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize data to identify trends and patterns.
* Predictive Modeling: Implement Gradient Boosting Regressors and other models to forecast air quality.
* Health Impact Analysis: Correlate air quality with public health metrics to understand impacts.
  
## Key Findings
* Seasonal Variations: Notable increases in pollutant levels and associated risks of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases during winter months.
* Model Accuracy: Predictive models showed high accuracy, with an R-squared value of 0.94, indicating robustness in predicting PM2.5 levels.
